## Week-1-refactor
A refactoring of an existing codebase, though functional on front end was lacking in structure and search engine optimization in the back end. 

## Features
* Restructured html into semantically appropriate elements. 
* Applied alt attributes to images. 
* Fixed broken URLs. 
* Given the page an appropriate title. 
* Tidied up CSS, removing redundancies

## Reasoning
Web pages need to have semantically appropriate html, alt img attributes and a title (among other things) for two main reasons: firstly for future developers to come and access/change the code, and secondly for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The 'correctness' and accessibility of the site partially determine its page ranking in search engines. 

## Challenges
This repo was challenging at first as I was fairly new to restructuring html and its stylesheet. However, once I took a top-down, left to right approach it became much easier to change something and determine whether it had worked or fixed my problem.
